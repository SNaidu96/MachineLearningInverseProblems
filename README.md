Code for paper titled 'Machine Learning Approach to detect anisotropy and inclusion properties in Electrical Impedance Tomography

This publication has emanated from research conducted with the financial support of Science Foundation Ireland under Grant number 18/CRT/6049. 



Run DatasetGeneration(number_of_points)
This calls GeometryGeneration(), PdeConditions1, Voltage_Tk, VNodes, D_NMatrix
Default number of inclusions in a tank is 1. 

Change specific conductivity used for inclusion/tank in PdeConditiona1
Use GeometryGeneration_MultInc for multiple inclusions
